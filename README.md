# Quick_Maths

This is an AI system built using computer vision and convolutional neural network in order to solve/evaluate handwritten math equations. All four function operators are supported along with exponents, trigonometric functions, pi and e. If you wish to solve for a variable, denote that variable using an "a" character. 

You can run this system on your own image by running "python main.py" followed by the path to your image
